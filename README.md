# Verilog-Project-ANDGate

Verilator files (systemVerilog, testbench, and executables for Verilator) (Personal learning project)

**Keep in mind that this is an educational project that I am doing for fun (not an official source for Verilator content)**

This is a Clocked AND-Gate written in verilog (Test.sv) and a testbench to simulate the AND-Gate written in C++ (test.cpp).
There is also a waveform file called waveform.vcd which can be sent to GTKWave to see the outputs of the testbench

There are many more files, some of which are used in the Verilator compilation, and included in the C++ testbench to access the circuit's description

I have also attached some pictures of the testbench output and the GTKWave simulation results

The rest of the files, I don't have a use for, nor do I know what they are for. They were part of the verilator and testbench output, so
I included them here for possible future reference

**Again, this is a student project. Please consult the documentation that Verilator has on their website for verified content**
